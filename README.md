WebGL Starter Program
=======================
These files will help you get started with using WebGL. It's well commented and has all the things needed to set up a basic WebGL program. 

To use the program, you'll need a relatively new web browser. For editing, we suggest using Notepad++ or Sublime text. Feel free to take these files
and build your own projects!
